# Integration Planning Complete

**Agent:** 2L Integration Planner (Iplanner)
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-27T00:00:00Z
**Iteration:** plan-5/iteration-5
**Round:** 1

## Summary

Successfully analyzed 3 builder outputs and created comprehensive integration plan.

## Deliverables Created

1. integration-plan.md (Main planning document)
2. INTEGRATION-SUMMARY.md (Quick reference)
3. INTEGRATOR-CHECKLIST.md (Execution guide)
4. README.md (Directory overview)
5. .iplanner-complete (This file)

## Analysis Results

**Total Builders:** 3 (all COMPLETE)
**Total Zones:** 7
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Estimated Integration Time:** 45-60 minutes
**Integrators Required:** 1

## Key Findings

1. Builder-1 and Builder-3 successfully coordinated on GlowButton.tsx
2. Builder-2 added new dependency (react-focus-lock) - requires verification
3. All changes are backward compatible
4. Zero blocking issues identified
5. Integration is straightforward with clear strategies for each zone

## Next Steps

1. Integrator reads integration-plan.md
2. Integrator executes using INTEGRATOR-CHECKLIST.md
3. Integration report created
4. Hand off to ivalidator for validation

## Event Logging

Attempted to log agent_complete event to 2L orchestrator.
Event logging is optional and fails gracefully if unavailable.
