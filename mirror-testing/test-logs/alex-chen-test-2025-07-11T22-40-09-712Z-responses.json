I was thinking I could start by reaching out to some people at work or maybe connect with local university students.

I keep telling myself I’ll look into it “soon,” but then I worry I don’t know enough yet.\n\nRELATIONSHIP: I want to believe I could do this, but it just feels a little out of reach right now. Sometimes I think maybe I can, since people do ask me for advice sometimes, but most of the time I just worry I’ll mess it up or that I’m not qualified enough. I hope I can work up the courage to at least try.\n\nOFFERING: I’m willing to give my time, and I hope I could give some encouragement to others. Maybe I could set aside an hour a week or something.
