      "dream": "I think the dream that stands out for me right now is to lead a creative team on a project that actually makes a difference in people’s day-to-day lives—maybe something related to accessibility or education, though I’m still not completely sure my ideas are unique enough to have an impact.",
      "plan": "Well, I’ve started outlining a proposal for a new app, and I’ve been reaching out (kind of hesitantly) to a few colleagues who have experience with product launches. I’ve done some market research, and I guess I’ve organized a couple of brainstorming sessions, but honestly, I’m not sure I’m the right person to move this forward. Still, I’m trying to piece together a roadmap, even if it feels like I’m missing some important steps.",

      "relationship": "I don’t know if I truly believe I can do it. There are days when I see some potential in my background, like how I’ve managed previous projects, but most of the time, I second-guess whether I have what it takes to lead something bigger. I hope I can get there, but I’m not entirely convinced I deserve to.",
      "offering": "I’d like to say I’m willing to give my full attention and energy, but sometimes I hold back because I’m worried I’ll fail or let others down. Still, I’m putting in extra hours here and there, and I do care a lot about getting it right, so maybe I can offer my persistence, even if it’s not always consistent.",
